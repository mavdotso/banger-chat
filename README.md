## Thesis

1. All I can do at this point is to simply release a fast basic chat with good UI/UX that doesn't break by monday. I can't compete with the app another dev made, I probably can't compete with rooms. But if I can be first, I can do this.

2. I'm doing it for myself and my portfolio. This has to be a working app that gives me a job.
